def connect_printer() -> tuple:
    """
    Attempts to connect to a network printer and configure it for text printing.

    The function tries to establish a connection with the printer up to a maximum number of
    attempts defined by MAX_ATTEMPTS. On each attempt, it:
      - Instantiates a Network printer object using the PRINTER_IP.
      - Sets the printer's character encoding to 'CP858' (this may be adjusted based on the printer).
      - Opens the connection to the printer.
      - Checks if the printer is online, and if so, sends an empty text to verify connectivity,
        then returns a tuple (True, printer).

    If the printer is not online, the connection is closed and the function waits for 2 seconds
    before retrying. In case of any exception during connection, the error is logged with the Logger.
    If the connection fails after all attempts, the function returns (False, None).

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple where the first element is a boolean indicating whether the connection
               was successful, and the second element is the printer object (or None if unsuccessful).
